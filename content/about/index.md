{{<bundle-image name="about.jpg" >}}

I'm Pranav , an interdisciplanary designer/engineer/technologist, currently residing in Shanghai. 

I have previously worked in design agencies in China and the Netherlands developing installations and prototypes for new product development. 

My personal work is usually related to critical reflections of our daily interaction with technology. Sometimes digital, yet mainly physical quirky tech black-boxes, giving the public a fun/serious questioning narrative about the problems and nuances in our natural and digital living environment.

Feel free to contact and talk about projects.
