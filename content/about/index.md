## Pranav -> designer/technologist

I spent my early career working primarily in Shanghai, China developing interactive experiences and 0->1 product prototypes for the fast-paced Chinese market. Working in small agencies / startups, being invloved in different stages of product development taught me a lot about building fast, testing products with users early and collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds. 

Currently in the UK, designing Future Interior Experiences for [Jaguar LandRover (JLR)](https://www.jlr.com).

**Technology & Methodologies**

Over the years I have used various technologies & methodologies to varying different levels, many of which I have listed here (in no order):

  "Design": [
    "Figma", "Miro","Illustrator", "Photoshop",
    "Design Thinking Workshop Facilitator", "User Journey Mapping"
  ],
  "Hardware": [

In my free time, I like to build things (mainly physical & sometimes digital) that help me with my work, hobby and that inspire me. You can also find my volunteering at Repair Cafe in Coventry City Center.
