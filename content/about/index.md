## Pranav -> designer/technologist

This website is a collection of my old projects, both hobby and some professional work.

I spent my early career working primarily in Shanghai, China developing interactive experiences and 0->1 product prototypes for the fast-paced Chinese market. Working in small agencies / startups, being invloved in different stages of product development taught me a lot about building fast, testing products with users early and collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds. 

Currently in the UK, working on Designing Future Interior Experiences for [Jaguar LandRover (JLR)](https://www.jlr.com).

In my free time, I like to build things (mainly physical & sometimes digital) that help me with my work, hobby and that inspire me. You can also find my volunteering at Repair Cafe in Coventry City Center. 

Feel free to [contact](mailto:pranavb104@gmail.com) to chat about my current/past work.
