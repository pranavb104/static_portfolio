## Pranav -> designer/technologist

I spent my early career working primarily in Shanghai, China developing interactive experiences and 0->1 product prototypes for the fast-paced Chinese market. Working in small agencies / startups, being invloved in different stages of product development taught me a lot about building fast, testing products with users early and collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds. 

Currently in the UK, designing future interior Experiences for [Jaguar LandRover (JLR)](https://www.jlr.com).

**The work I do usually sits between**
- Design, Strategy & Engineering
- Writing code, designing HW & conceptual decomposition
- Early stage ambiguous problems, 0->1 briefs
- Using prototyping as a tool for inquiry & storytelling

**Technology & Methodologies**

Over the years I have used various technologies & methodologies to varying different levels, many of which I have listed here (in no order):

_JavaScript, C++, Python, Docker, Git, WebRTC, C, OpenFrameworks, Figma, Miro, Illustrator, Photoshop, Conceptual Thinking, Creative Workshop Facilitator, Experience decomposition, User Journey Mapping, WebSockets, Vue Framework, HTML,CSS MQTT, IOT Systems, RPI, Arduino, ESP, MCU’s, SOC's, Sensors, Actuators, I2C/SPI/CAN/LIN, DMX Lighting, ROS 1, Fusion 360, KiCAD PCB Design, SMD Soldering, 3D printing_
 
In my free time, I like to build things (mainly physical & sometimes digital) that help me with my work, hobby and that inspire me. You can also find my volunteering at Repair Cafe in Coventry City Center.
