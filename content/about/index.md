{{<bundle-image name="about.png" >}}

I'm Pranav , an interdisciplanary designer/engineer/technologist, currently residing in Shanghai. 

I have previously worked in design agencies in China and the Netherlands developing installations and prototypes for new product development. 

My personal work is related to critical reflections of the technologies and infrastructures that shape our interactions with environmental systems and our perceptions of it. Sometimes digital, yet mainly physical eccentric objects, giving the public a fun/serious questioning narrative about the problems and nuances in our natural and digital living environment.

Feel free to contact and talk about projects.
