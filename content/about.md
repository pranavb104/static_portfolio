{{< figure src= "/archie/about.jpg" title="" class="contentImgBig" >}}

I'm Pranav , an interdisciplanary designer/engineer/technologist, currently residing in Shanghai. 

I have previously worked in design agencies in China and the Netherlands developing installations and prototypes for new product development. 

My personal work is usually related to critical reflections of our daily interaction with technology and related complex systems and how can we build supporting tools to be consciously connected with our natural surrounding systems.

We currently live in a reality which is far from the observed truth which leaves our bodies and minds disconnected from surrounding space and time. In my work , I try to address such topics, to bring socioeconomic precession to our distorted reality, mainly by working with humans, machines, tools and our natural counterparts.

Feel free to contact and talk about projects.
