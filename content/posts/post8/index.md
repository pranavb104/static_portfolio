Mariann Juhl from Denmark was diagnosed with fibromialgia which did not allow her to use a computer mouse or sit statically in front of a screen. She contacted Institue of Applied Motions to see how a full body interface could help her get back to work and explore new ways of using one's body. This led to the workshop, where we experimented and mentored students to explore creative ways to interface the body with the computer. Students from the Technical College teamed up to create three different types of interfaces, one for gaming, one for the mouse and one to make music with the body.
