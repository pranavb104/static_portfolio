While working with Institute of Applied Motions designing emotional furniture, we were contacted by a user from Denmark dealing with chronic pain who couldn't use a computer mouse while working for long hours in front of a screen. 

After a few discussions and video calls we wanted to see how a body-centred interface could help her get back to work and use her computer to do creative work. This led to the workshop, where we experimented and mentored students to explore creative ways to interface the body with the computer. 
Students from the Technical College in Denmark teamed up to create three different types of interfaces, one for gaming, one for the mouse and one to make music with the body.
