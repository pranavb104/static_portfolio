A tattoo-removal installation I designed while working for a company in the Netherlands. Here I was responsible for the physical design(structure) of the booth and the back-front end integration. I used a Kinect to track the movements of the hand and design the front-end panels with OpenFrameworks. You can see the working concept below.
