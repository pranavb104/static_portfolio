This mask is a fictional resemblance that uses a simple circuit with a bunch of transistors to amplify the incoming signal for detection of negative ions. Negative ions are [said](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213340/) to found in abundance near nature/mountains/waterfalls etcâ€¦, also emitted by air purifiers as they help in settling dust.

I hooked up this circuit to a mask. Upon detection of the ions, the led glows and trips a small vibrating motor which sits near the nasal support providing feedback. 

The first prototype that kinda works, but needs better analog circuitry for precise detection . Will hopefully rework this in the future when I feel there is a need ;D
