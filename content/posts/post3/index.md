A tattoo-removal booth experience 
Here I was responsible for writing the software and designing the physical artifacts for the experience. The content was made by my colleague. The KinectV2.0 tracked depth and movements of the hand, all written in [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc) C++. You can see the working installation below.
